# augmentation_imgaug
Provided is the code for performing 10 image augmentations on a training set, with forming corresponding labels (.txt), ready to be used in yolov5.

I have used the imgaug library to perform 10 data augmentations for the task of object detection. 
This code also provides a method to directly upload this training zip file to yolov5 by creating images for data augmentations, and their corresponding label (information 
regarding the bounding boxes.)
